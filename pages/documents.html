Reset
The basic resets ensure that html elements work consistently across all browsers. 
 
Typography
 
No Print
Users can add a ‘printOnly’ class to areas that will only show when printed. 
 
Forms
The forms in Fresh Plate are standard HTML/CSS forms with some enhancements. Below is a list of classes that format various objects such as text inputs, buttons, fieldsets, labels, etc. Be sure and check with your Hosting provider as forms may require scripts.

Included with the download is a contactForm.html and ThankYou.html that may be used as guides to creating your own forms. They are in the plugin directory. They are set up to work on an ipage.com supplied website. You will need to change the script path and the email address in the input hidden field as well as verify the path to Thankyou.html. Note: the example forms in the example pages do not work. No eMail or Data is sent.
 
Grid System
The grid system in FreshPlate framework is based on 960px wide grid - 12 column grid solution. Each column width is 100% / 12 = 8.33%. 
All rows should be wrapped in a div .
All columns should be wrapped in a 'row' and should add up to 12.
The grid acts responsively with the following breakpoints:
Mobile portrait (Default) - Single column. No need to define. But for those users who want more granular control of mobile screen you can use classes to further split your container. [[Available classes .col-mp-1 - .col-mp-12]
Mobile landscape - @media screen (min-device-width: 600px)
	[Available classes .col-ml-1 - .col-ml-12]
Tablet- @media screen (min-width: 768px)
	[Available classes .col-tb-1 - .col-tb-12]
Large screen-  @media screen (min-width: 1200px)
     [Available classes .col-lg-1 - .col-lg-12]
 
 
Example HTML:
 <div  class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-3 col-tb-3 col-ml-6">
               
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3 col-tb-6 col-ml-6">
              
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3 col-tb-3 col-ml-6">
             
           </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3 col-tb-12 col-ml-6">
 
            </div>
</div>

You can add the following classes to tables:

‘striped-even’ or ‘striped-odd’ to create striping

(Note: green stripes is just an example to make it stand out… )
‘Center’ to center the table
‘hover-row’ to be able to highlight a row when cursor mouses over

‘hover-cell’ to be able to highlight a cell when cursor mouses over
